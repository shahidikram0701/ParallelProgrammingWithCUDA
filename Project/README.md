# ECE408/CS483 Final Project

## Introduction

In this final project, you will be implementing and optimizing the forward-pass of a convolutional layer using CUDA. Convolutional layers are the primary building blocks of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are used in many machine learning tasks like image classification, object detection, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In general, CNNs work well on tasks where the data/input features have some level of spatial relationship.

You will be working with a **modified** version of the LeNet-5 architecture shown below.

Your optimized CUDA implementation of the convolutional layer will be used to perform inference for layers C1 and C3 (shown in red) in the figure above. We will be leveraging the [mini-dnn-cpp](https://github.com/iamhankai/mini-dnn-cpp) (Mini-DNN) framework for implementing the modified LeNet-5. 

We will be using the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), where the inputs to the network will be a batch of 10,000 single channel images, each with dimensions of 86 x 86 pixels. The output layer consists of 10 nodes, where each node represents the likelihood of the input belonging to one of the 10 classes (T-shirt, dress, sneaker, boot etc.)

The overall learning objectives for this project are:
* Demonstrating command of CUDA and optimization approaches by designing and implementing an optimized neural-network convolutional layer forward pass
* Obtaining practical experience in analyzing and fine tuning CUDA kernels through the use of profiling tools like Nsight Systems (`nsys`) and Nsight-Compute (`nv-nsight-cu`)

## Milestone 1: Rai Installation, CPU convolution, Profiling

### Testing Rai
Run the default Mini-DNN forward pass using rai without any CPU/GPU implementation.

Use RAI to run a batch forward pass on some test data.

    rai -p <project-folder> 


This will upload your project directory to rai and move it to `/src`, where the execution specified in `rai_build.yml` will occur. 

***Understanding rai_build.yml***

The `image:` key specifies the environment that the rest of the execution will occur in.
This environment includes the Mini-DNN framework as well as the model definition and pre-trained weights that will be used to do inference. **(Do not modify this entry)**

The `resources:` key specifies what computation resources will be available to the execution. **(Do not modify this entry)**

The `commands:` key specifies the recipe that rai will execute. First, the project files are copied to the `/build/student_code` directory so that we have a record of your code along with your performance.
Then the files in `custom` are copied to `/ece408/project/src/layer/custom` in the Mini-DNN source tree and the pretrained weights are copied to `/build`. Finally, Mini-DNN is recompiled with your custom code.

`./m1 100` runs the code specified in `m1.cc` program for a batch of 100 input images. 

You should see the following output:

    âœ± Running /bin/bash -c "./m1 100"
    Test batch size: 100
    Loading fashion-mnist data...Done
    Loading model...Done
    Conv-CPU==
    Op Time: 0.000655 ms
    Conv-CPU==
    Op Time: 0.000246 ms
    Test Accuracy: 0.08

It is okay for the accuracy is low here since you haven't implemented the convolutional layers yet.

### CPU Implementation

The algorithm:

    for b = 0 .. Batch                     // for each image in the batch 
        for m = 0 .. Map_out               // for each output feature maps
            for h = 0 .. Height_out        // for each output element
                for w = 0 .. Width_out
                {
                    output[b][m][h][w] = 0;
                    for c = 0 .. Channel   // sum over all input feature maps
                        for p = 0 .. K // KxK filter
                            for q = 0 .. K
                                output[b][m][h][w] += input[b][c][h + p][w + q] * k[m][c][p][q]
                }

*Source: https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks#layer*

Modify `rai_build.yml` to invoke

    - /bin/bash -c "./m1"

The CPU implementation is slow and will take several minutes to run. (For instance, a correct implementation with 10k images may take 13+ mins to run). If you want to iterate quickly when developing code using smaller batch sizes, see [Specifying Batch Size](#specifying-batch-size). When your implementation is correct, you should see output like this:

    Test batch size: 1000
    Loading fashion-mnist data...Done
    Loading model...Done
    Conv-CPU==
    Op Time: 7425.3 ms
    Conv-CPU==
    Op Time: 21371.4 ms
    Test Accuracy: 0.886

Every time your layer is invoked, it will print the "Op Time," the time spent working on that layer.
Since the network has two convolutional layers, two times will be printed.
You can time the whole program execution by modifying `rai_build.yml` with

    - /bin/bash -c "time ./m1"

### Specifying Batch Size

`./m1`, `./m2`, `./m3` and `./final` all take one optional argument: the dataset size.  
If the correctness for each possible batch size is as below, you can be reasonably confident your implementation is right. The correctness does depend on the data size. 

For example, to check your accuracy on the full data size of 10,000, you could modify `rai_build.yml` to run

    - /bin/bash -c "./m1 10000"

| Number of Images | Accuracy  |
| -----------------| --------- |
| 100              | 0.86 |
| 1000             | 0.886 |
| 10000            | 0.8714 |


### Use Gprof to profile your CPU implementation

You will use `gprof` to profile the execution of your CPU forward convolution implementation.

We compile and link your `cpu-new-forward.cc` with the `-pg` flag, which creates a `gmon.out` artifact containing profile information when the binary `m1` is executed.  To analyze this information in human readable form, modify `rai_build.yml` and modify the line to redirect `gprof` output as `outfile`.
 
    - /bin/bash -c "./m1 1000 && gprof -Q m1 gmon.out > outfile"

By default, `gprof` prints both a flat profile and a call graph (see "Interpreting gprof's Output" in the [GNU gprof Documentation](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/index.html)).  With the `-Q` flag, we only print the flat profile.  The information you need can be found near the beginning of `gprof`'s output. You can download your build folder and process the output `outfile` with `grep` (with your function's name) or `head`. You can also open it with text editor if you want to examine the complete output.

The provided `m1.cc` is identical to the one used by `--submit=m1`

## Milestone 2: Baseline Convolutional Kernel

### Create a GPU Implementation

The host code is separated in 3 parts. `conv_forward_gpu_prolog` allocates memory and copies data from host to device (Note: the device pointers given to you in this function are double pointers). `conv_forward_gpu` computes kernel dimensions and invokes kernel. `conv_forward_gpu_epilog` copies output back to host and free the device memory. 

Modify `rai_build.yml` to run with batch_size=10000. Run

    - /bin/bash -c "./m2"

to use your GPU implementation.
If your implementation is correct, it will show the same correctness as Milestone 1. 
The sum of OP times on batch_size=10000 should be approximately 170ms if you implement the basic kernel from Lecture 12 correctly. 

### Use Nsight-Systems and Nsight-Compute for initial Performance Results


To ensure accurate profiling results,
we have created an exclusive queue for you. 
To submit profiling job on the exclusive queue, run:

    rai --queue rai_amd64_exclusive -p <project-folder> 

**Please only use the exclusive queue for the profiling purpose. Use the default queue to test your code.**

Since profiling takes a while, the exclusive queue may get backed up when the deadline approaches. So we encourage you to start early on this Milestone. You can query the number of pending jobs on the exclusive queue by the following command:

    rai -p . --queue=rai_amd64_exclusive queued


***System level profiling using Nsight-Systems***

We will learn how to use `nsys` (Nsight Systems) to profile the execution at the application level.

Once you've gotten the appropriate accuracy results, generate a profile using `nsys`. Make sure `rai_build.yml` is configured for a GPU run. 
You have to remove `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-pg` in cmake and make line of your `rai_build.yml`:

    - /bin/bash -c "cmake /ece408/project/ && make -j8"

Then, modify `rai_build.yml` to generate a profile instead of just executing the code.

    - /bin/bash -c "nsys profile --stats=true ./m2"

You should see something that looks like the following (but not identical):

~~~bash

~~~

The CUDA API Statistics section shows the CUDA API calls that are executed. The CUDA Kernel Statistics lists all the kernels that were executed during the profiling session. There are also more details on the CUDA memory operations (CudaMemcpy) listed.
There are columns corresponding to percentage of time consumed, total time, number of calls, and average/min/max time of those calls. Use **your** `nsys` profiling output corresponding to the section above to answer the questions for your report.

You can find more information about `nsys` in the [Nsight Systems Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/#cli-profiling)

***Kernel level profiling using Nsight-Compute***

Nsight-Systems does not give you detailed kernel level performance metrics. For that, we will need to use `nv-nsight-cu-cli` (Nsight-Compute). 

Modify `rai_build.yml` to use `nv-nsight-cu-cli` to save some timeline and analysis information, as described in [profiling](#profiling).

You will see performance metrics for two kernel launches, one for each layer.
The [Nsight Compute installation](#nsight-compute-installation) section describes how to install Nsight-Compute GUI on your personal machine. Note that you do not need CUDA to be installed. 

## Milestone 3: GPU Convolution Kernel Optimizations

### Add GPU Optimizations

When profiling your optimizations use the `--queue rai_amd64_exclusive` flag to run your code on the exclusive server so that it doesn't contest with other students submissions and you can have the most accurate timing results. 

### Interpreting the timing output from rai

You will see two types of times reported per layer as follows


    âœ± Running bash -c "./m3 1000"   \\ Output will appear after run is complete.
    Test batch size: 1000
    Loading fashion-mnist data...Done
    Loading model...Done
    Conv-GPU==
    Layer Time: 61.1231 ms
    Op Time: 4.82135 ms
    Conv-GPU==
    Layer Time: 55.4437 ms
    Op Time: 16.6154 ms
    
    Test Accuracy: 0.886


1. "Op Time" - This is time between the last cudaMemcpy call before your first kernel call and the first cudaMemcpy after your last kernel call (i.e. just `new-forward.cu -> conv_forward_gpu()`). It does not include the cudaMemcpy times.
2. "Layer Time" - This is the total time taken to perform the convolution layer (C1 or C3). It includes the times for all kernel and CUDA API calls (i.e. the total time of all three `new-forward.cu -> conv_forward_gpu*` functions).

### Performance Analysis with Nsight-Systems and Nsight-Compute

Use the NVIDIA Nsight-Systems(`nsys`) and Nsight-Compute(`nv-nsight-cu-cli`) and your analysis information to describe the effect that your optimizations had on the performance of your convolution.
If possible, you should try to separate the effect of each optimization in your analysis.

## Optimizations

These are the list of optimizations we will consider valid for Milestone 3. You should implement 10 points worth of optimizations in order to recieve full credit for Milestone 3. If you would like to impelement a potential optimization that is not on this list, please consult a TA or instructor beforehand to verify that the optimization is valid and to assign it a point value.

* Tiled shared memory convolution 
* Shared memory matrix multiplication and input matrix unrolling
* Kernel fusion for unrolling and matrix-multiplication (requires previous optimization)
* Weight matrix (kernel values) in constant memory 
* Tuning with restrict and loop unrolling (considered as one optimization only if you do both)
* Sweeping various parameters to find best values (block sizes, amount of thread coarsening)
* Multiple kernel implementations for different layer sizes 
* Input channel reduction: tree
* Input channel reduction: atomics
* Fixed point (FP16) arithmetic. (note this can modify model accuracy slightly)
* Using Streams to overlap computation with data transfer
* An advanced matrix multiplication algorithm (register-tiled, for example)
* Using Tensor Cores to speed up matrix multiplication
* Overlap-Add method for FFT-based convolution (note this is **very** hard, and may not yield a large performace increase due to mask size)


## Appendix

### Skeleton Code Description
`custom/cpu-new-forward.cc` and `custom/new-forward.cu` containes skeleton implementations for the CPU and GPU convolutions respectively. You can complete the project by modifying these two files only. `custom/cpu-new-forward.h` and `custom/gpu-new-forward.h` are the respective header files. You need not modify these files unless you need to declare your own functions.

The code in `m1.cc`, `m2.cc`, `m3.cc` and `final.cc` are the top level files that are executed for each milestone. You should not be modifying these files.

### Checking for Errors

Within `custom/new-forward.cu`, you can use the predefined error handling code to catch CUDA errors or, you can define a macro/function similar to `wbCheck` used in WebGPU.

To catch memory errors, prepend your command with `cuda-memcheck`. 
Assume we want to check memory errors on Milestone3 binary, 
in your `rai_build.yml`, run 

    - /bin/bash -c "cuda-memcheck ./m3"

### Profiling

You can gather system level performance information using `nsys`.

For detailed kernel level GPU profiling, use `nv-nsight-cu-cli` and view that information with `nv-nsight-cu`. To enable profiling with these tools,
you have to remove `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-pg` in cmake and make line of your `rai_build.yml`:

    - /bin/bash -c "cmake /ece408/project/ && make -j8"

You can see some simple information like so (as we did in milestone 2):

    - /bin/bash -c "nsys profile --stats=true <your command here>"

You can additionally gather some detailed kernel level performance metrics.

    - /bin/bash -c "nv-nsight-cu-cli --section '.*' -o analysis_file <your command here>"

This will generate `analysis_file.ncu-rep`.
`--section '.*'` may significantly slow the run time since it is profiling all the metrics. You may wish to modify the command to run on smaller datasets during this profiling.

You will need to follow the link rai prints after the execution to retrieve these files.
You can use the NVIDIA Nsight Compute GUI (`nv-nsight-cu`) to import those files.
You will need to install NVIDIA NSight Compute on your own machine. It can be downloaded as a standalone application. See instructions [here](#nsight-compute-installation)

To import the files:
* Launch the GUI `/usr/local/NVIDIA-Nsight-Compute/nv-nsight-cu` (or from wherever you installed it)
* Close the intial Quick Launch menu
* Go to File > Open File and select the `.ncu-rep` file from the `\build` folder you downloaded from rai (note that the downloaded file is a `TAR` file, not a `TAR.GZ` as the name implies).

*OR*
* Directly launch from the terminal `/usr/local/NVIDIA-Nsight-Compute/nv-nsight-cu <filename>.ncu-rep`

For a high-level overview of the Nsight software, visit [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/tools-overview).

### Nsight-compute Installation

Nsight-Compute can be installed as a standalone application. You do not need CUDA to be installed. You can download the installer from NVIDIA's [website](https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworksdownload#?dn=nsight-compute-2020-3-0)
